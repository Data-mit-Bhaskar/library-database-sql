# **Library Database Management System (SQL)**
*A structured SQL-based database system for library operations, designed as part of my **MSc. Data Analytics** program at Berlin School of Business & Innovation (BSBI).*

---

## **📌 Overview**
This project demonstrates my expertise in **database design, SQL implementation, and data analysis**—skills I’ve applied professionally at **Sakon (GSG)** and **Mercedes-Benz** to optimize data workflows and improve decision-making. The system simulates a **library’s core operations**, including:
- **Cataloging books and members**
- **Tracking loans and returns**
- **Generating analytical reports** (e.g., overdue books, member borrowing trends)
- **Ensuring data integrity** through normalization (3NF) and indexing.

The project aligns with my **CV highlights**:
✅ **Reduced data errors by 11%** (Sakon) → Validated here via SQL constraints and data validation.
✅ **Optimized ETL processes by 20%** (Sakon) → Reflected in automated SQL scripts and indexed queries.
✅ **Developed Power BI dashboards** → Translated here into **SQL-based analytical queries** for reporting.
